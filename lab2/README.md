# Lab Assignment 2
Refer to [INSTRUCTIONS.pdf](./INSTRUCTIONS.pdf) for the assignment
instructions.
To set up the proxy server, run:
```bash
./sshXX 1 CCID
```
where *CCID* needs to be replaced with the actual value.

**NOTE**:  
The password for the proxy server is the one given to you privately on a piece
of paper.

## Part I:
Refer to [VM Setup](./slide/vm_setup.pdf) for instructions on how to change
passwords for both virtual machines.

| Platform | Password  |
|:--------:|:---------:|
| Linux    | c333VMlab |
| Windows  | c333VMlab |

Linux *root* password = "c333VMlab" without quotation marks.
Windows *administrator* password = "c333VMlab" without quotation marks.

We can decide on better passwords later on for creating a strong password with
reasons behind the choice.

## Part II:
Refer to [VM Setup](./slide/vm_setup.pdf) for instructions on how to
take snapshots of both virtual machines before doing anything else;
[Firewall Setup](./slide/firewall_setup.pdf) has hints on how to set up
**HTTP** and **FTP** service properly.

Recompiled Linux so that the correct iptables have been enabled.
